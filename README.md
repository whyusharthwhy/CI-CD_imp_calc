•	Entered compound name’s spelling and format (‘-’, spaces etc.) should be same as that present in the chromatogram <br />
•	The RSD file should be named in the following format “<compound name>-areas” where the compound name’s spelling and format (‘-’, spaces etc.) should be same as that present in the chromatogram <br />
•	Please ensure that the column names of the tables in the PDF files follow the below naming convention <br />
&emsp; o 'Name', 'Ret. Time', 'Area' in Shimadzu chromatograms and 'Title ', 'Area', 'Ret. Time' in Shimadzu RSD files <br />
&emsp; o For RS:  ‘Name', 'RT', 'Area' in Empower chromatograms and 'SampleName', 'Area', ‘RT’ in Empower RSD files <br />
&emsp; o	For Assay: 'Name', 'Area\n(µV*sec)', 'RT' in Empower chromatograms and 'SampleName', 'Area', ‘RT’ in Empower RSD files <br />
•	Please check with the developer [Pawan Kurada] if the sample preparation values for Assay and RS as well as the RRF values for the compound you have entered are <br />present in the master sheets stored in the backend <br />
•	For Acyclovir calculation you have to upload two RSD files one with the name “Acyclovir-areas” and other with the name “Impurity-B-areas “<br />
•	For impurity vs impurity calculation of Ketorolac or Propofol please ensure there are six RSD files in the format “Ketorolac Tromethamine-standard-x” or “Propofol-standard-x” where x ranges from 1 to 6 <br />
•	For the Assay calculation of sub-compounds like Methyl Paraben/ Propyl Paraben/P-Hydroxy benzoic acid- enter the sub-compound’s name and other details and proceed with the assay calculation as usual. <br />
